# diffusers-unet-1d-condition
A contribution to huggingface diffusers with conditional 1d unet implementation

# Running
This is just a codebase as a supplement to [huggingface diffusers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index). The code is a counterpart to the [UNet2DConditionModel](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/models/unets/unet_2d_condition.py). Simply try the notebook for UNet1DConditionModel definition and forward pass example.
